boya{A}   -> Number of boya features = A
est{B}    -> Number of station festures = b
ca{C}     -> Number of flow feature = C
div-{D}   -> levels discretization = D
reg-{E}   -> Number of regions = E

Example:

sequential_patterns_boya3_est7_ca1_div-3_reg-4_minsup4.

boya3 -> Number of boya features = 3
est7 -> Number of station features = 4
ca1   -> Number of flow feature = 1
div-3 -> levels discretization = 3
reg-4 -> Number of regions = 4
minsup4 -> Min Support = 4
